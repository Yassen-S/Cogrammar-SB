"""
AIM
The aim of this programme is to take a users name and age and store it in a variable. 
This will allow us to print it later.

METHODOLOGY 
I will be using two functions and two variables to carry out this task. 
First I will use the "input" function to prompt the user to enter name, at the same time I will store this in a variable.
I will repeat this process for the age.

# Prompting user for input and storing input in a variable (name).
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
# Printing the value assigned to the (name) variable.
print(name)

# Prompting user for input and storing input in a variable (name).
age = input("Please enter your age: ")
# Printing the value assigned to the (name) variable.
print(age)

# Printing the statement "Hello World!".
print("Hello World!")
